She could feel the cold, wet pavement against her cheek and the tears streaming across her face as she lay helpless, consciousness quickly fading and shielding her belly as tightly as she could without causing a self incision from the pressure of her titanium arm. "No", she screamed, "I'll never let you take our baby"...

Ophelia is one of the government's most successful cyborg experiments. Trained in over 17 different combat styles with a 100% defense mission efficiency rate, yet, she has assimilated into normal living society carrying on about typical daily habits as perfectly as one could hope. She cheerfully works as a barista in one of the US's most thriving cities, Seattle, lives with her cat, Snookers, and binge watches her favorite shows on Netflix during her downtime just like any other human being.

She is prepped and ready to be unveiled at the nation's first CIP event. CIP is the Cyborg Introduction Program that guides humans of the world into adjusting to a life where they live amongst the government's new breed of metahumans. Recruited when she was only 2 years old after being left orphaned by her mother who was declared medically unfit to care for her child and placed in an asylum, she has no recollection of things before becoming a cyborg.

As far as anyone knows, Ophelia's life is pretty great.
