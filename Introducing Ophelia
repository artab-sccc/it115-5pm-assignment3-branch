She could feel the cold, wet pavement against her cheek and the tears streaming across her face as she lay helpless, consciousness quickly fading and shielding her belly as tightly as she could without causing a self incision from the pressure of her titanium arm. "No", she screamed, "I'll never let you take our baby"...

Ophelia is one of the government's most successful cyborg experiments. Trained in over 17 different combat styles with a 100% defense mission efficiency rate, yet, she has assimilated into normal living society carrying on about typical daily habits as perfectly as one could hope. She cheerfully works as a barista in one of the US's most thriving cities, Pandora, lives with her cat, Snookers, and binge watches her favorite shows on Netflix during her downtime just like any other human being.

She is prepped and ready to be unveiled at the nation's first CIP event. CIP is the Cyborg Introduction Program that guides humans of the world into adjusting to a life where they live amongst the government's new breed of metahumans. Recruited when she was only 2 years old after being left orphaned by her mother who was declared medically unfit to care for her child and placed in an asylum, she has no recollection of things before becoming a cyborg.

As far as anyone knows, Ophelia's life is pretty great.

However, deep down inside, Ophelia feels like something was missing.

Growing up as a cyborg has had it's up and downs. Being created in Seattle, Opehlia grew up amongst humans. While Ophelia could do anything that was humanly impossible, she was unable to do anything "human"-ly. Ophelia had a hard time controling the strength of her limbs and would sometimes use full force without noticing. She would be chosen for all kinds of sports at recess time for her abilities: kicking the ball thousands of miles away, jumping at great heights and running at the speed of light. One might think this makes Ophelia look like a superhero, but Ophelia wanted to feel "normal." She wanted to compete with her fellow classmates on the same level and actually have some competition without dominating the game. She would always be given special treatment, be the highlight of the class or be prasied without reason. But, she didn't want to be in the spotlight - she just wanted to a live normally as a human would.

That's where Pandora comes in. A city of technology, a city for humankinds greatest inventions -  a city of hope. Moving away from Seattle to Pandora was one of Ophelia's greatest decisions in life: she was surrounded by "people" like her. Pandora contains over millions of lifeformsm, all living in harmony: humans, robots, aliens, you name it. Here, Ophelia didn't feel like the superhero. She wasn't in the spotlight; she felt like a normal person amongst society.
